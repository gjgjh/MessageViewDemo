# MessageViewDemo

MessageViewDemo is a demo android app written in Java that lets you view you messages on the map based on its location information. This is only a demo so there are actually lots of stuff that can be improved. Feel free to use these codes in your app if you find this demo useful.

## Get started

To build the project, download it and open it in Android Studio. All dependencies should automatically be fetched by Android Studio. The dependencies we used include AMapï¼Œ CardView, RecyclerView and Material Design.
